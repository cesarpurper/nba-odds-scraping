# nba-odds-scraping

This project is a simple scraper to scrape initial and end NBA odds from the website https://www.scoresandodds.com/

## Next steps

- refactoring the code that gets data from the table to better handle the game table behaviours
- studying more about the game details tab and parse data from the detail request as well(in the details tab is possible to get info about formation, minutes played, full line movements, etc)
